Wikiassoc
=========

This is Wikiassoc, a tool for generating term associations by analyzing the
link structure of Wikipedia (or any other wiki built on the MediaWiki
software).

To build and install Wikiassoc, you need a fairly modern C++ compiler
(tested with GCC 4.3 and Open64 4.2.2.2), the Boost libraries from
http://www.boost.org/ (including the Boost IOStreams library), zlib from
http://zlib.net/ and bzlib from http://www.bzip.org/. It is highly advisable
to use a C++ compiler that supports OpenMP, as Wikiassoc will be very slow
without it.

Wikiassoc uses the GNU build tools. Enter
    ./configure && make && make install
or see the file INSTALL for more detailed instructions. Currently, this only
installs a binary called wikiassoc.


Usage
-----

To compile an associative thesaurus with Wikiassoc, first download some files
from the Wikimedia database dump repository at http://download.wikimedia.org .
For example, say you want word associations in Latin. Fetch the files

    lawiki-YYYYMMDD-page.sql.gz
    lawiki-YYYYMMDD-pagelinks.sql.gz

and run the Wikiassoc program as

    wikiassoc lawiki-YYYYMMDD-page.sql.gz lawiki-YYYYMMDD-pagelinks.sql.gz \
      | gzip -c > lawiki-associations.txt

(Using gzip is highly recommended, as Wikiassoc produces a lot of output.)

You will get a log of what's happening on stderr. Note that Wikiassoc takes
a *lot* of memory; on the larger Wikipedias, it may be as much as 50GB or
more.
