Wikiassoc
=========

This is Wikiassoc, a tool for generating term associations by analyzing the
link structure of Wikipedia (or any other wiki built on the MediaWiki
software).

To build and install Wikiassoc, you need a fairly modern C++ compiler
(tested with GCC 4.3 and Open64 4.2.2.2), the Boost libraries from
http://www.boost.org/ (including the Boost IOStreams library), zlib from
http://zlib.net/ and bzlib from http://www.bzip.org/. It is highly advisable
to use a C++ compiler that supports OpenMP, as Wikiassoc will be very slow
without it.

Wikiassoc uses the GNU build tools. Enter
    ./configure && make && make install
or see the file INSTALL for more detailed instructions. Currently, this only
installs a binary called wikiassoc.


Usage
-----

To compile an associative thesaurus with Wikiassoc, first download some files
from the Wikimedia database dump repository at http://download.wikimedia.org .
For example, say you want word associations in Latin. Fetch the files

    lawiki-YYYYMMDD-page.sql.gz
    lawiki-YYYYMMDD-pagelinks.sql.gz

and run the Wikiassoc program as

    wikiassoc lawiki-YYYYMMDD-page.sql.gz lawiki-YYYYMMDD-pagelinks.sql.gz \
      | gzip -c > lawiki-associations.gz

(Using gzip is highly recommended, as Wikiassoc produces a lot of output.)

You will get a log of what's happening on stderr. Note that Wikiassoc takes
a *lot* of memory; on the larger Wikipedias, it may be as much as 50GB or
more.

In lawiki-associations.gz, you will find a text file with terms and indented
associations for the term:




What does it do?
----------------

For each article in the Wikipedia database dump, Wikiassoc looks at all the
articles that can be reached by following at most two links. It then weighs
all these articles by a scheme called pf-ibf, or path frequency-inverse
backlink frequency. For further explanation, refer to:
